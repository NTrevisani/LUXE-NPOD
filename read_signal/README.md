# LUXE Signal Distributions

Scripts to produce signal distributions for the LUXE-NPOD experiment (ALP -> $#gamma #gamma$).

The code uses some assumptions:
- the detector is always 100% efficient in detecting the photons hitting its surface
- the two photons produced by the ALP decay reach the detector only if the decay happens in the decay volume
